# 📚 Java DSA Practice

A Java-based collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implementations, organized by topic and designed to support learning, coding interviews, and software development.

## 📌 Topics Covered

* **Arrays & ArrayList** – Dynamic arrays and common operations.
* **Searching** – Linear Search, Binary Search.
* **Sorting** – Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
* **Recursion & Backtracking** – Foundational recursive patterns and exercises.
* **Strings** – String manipulation and pattern-based challenges.
* **Linked Lists** – Singly and doubly linked list implementations.
* **Stacks & Queues** – Stack operations and queue implementations.
* **Trees** – Binary tree structures with traversal techniques.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Applied via classes, objects, and principles in Java.
* **Time & Space Complexity** – Code-level considerations for performance.
* **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** – A mini-application blending OOP with game logic.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository was created to help you:

* Build strong problem-solving skills in **Java**.
* Establish a solid foundation in DSA—useful for **AI/ML**, software engineering, and coding interviews.
* Maintain a personal reference of implemented algorithms and structures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Structure

* **Language:** Java (100%)
* **IDE:** VS Code (or your preferred IDE)
* **Structure:** Organized into topic-wise folders, each containing relevant Java implementations and examples.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/royxlead/dsa-java.git
   cd dsa-java
   ```

2. **Explore Topics**
   Navigate through folders like `Sorting`, `Trees`, `StacksAndQueue`, etc., and open the Java files.

3. **Run Code Examples**

   * From IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse): run/debug the Java files directly.
   * From terminal:

     ```bash
     javac <TopicFolder>/<FileName>.java
     java <TopicFolder>.<FileName>
     ```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add **unit tests** (JUnit) to verify correctness.
* Include **time and space complexity notes** within comments.
* Expand with **graph algorithms** and **dynamic programming**.
