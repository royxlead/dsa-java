# Java DSA Practice

A Java-based collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implementations, organized by topic and designed to support your journey in problem-solving, coding interviews, and software development.

## Topics Covered

* **Arrays & ArrayList** – Dynamic arrays and common operations.
* **Searching** – Linear Search, Binary Search.
* **Sorting** – Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
* **Recursion & Backtracking** – Foundational recursive patterns and backtracking exercises.
* **Strings** – String manipulation and pattern-based challenges.
* **Linked Lists** – Singly and doubly linked list implementations.
* **Stacks & Queues** – Stack operations and queue implementations.
* **Trees** – Binary tree structures with traversal techniques.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Applied via classes, objects, and principles in Java.
* **Time & Space Complexity** – Code-level considerations for performance.
* **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** – A mini-application blending OOP with game logic.

## Purpose

This repository was created to help you:

* Build strong problem-solving skills in **Java**.
* Establish a solid foundation in DSA—useful for **AI/ML**, software engineering, and coding interviews.
* Maintain a personal reference of implemented algorithms and structures.
  ([GitHub][1])

## Tech Stack & Structure

* **Language:** Java (100%)
* **IDE:** VS Code (or your IDE of choice)
* The project is organized into topic-wise folders, each containing relevant Java implementations and examples.
  ([GitHub][1])

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/royxlead/dsa-java.git
   cd dsa-java
   ```

2. **Explore Topics:**
   Navigate through the folders like `Sorting`, `Trees`, `StacksAndQueue`, etc., and open the Java files for each topic.

3. **Run Code Examples:**

   * If using VS Code or similar IDE, simply run or debug the Java files.
   * Alternatively, from the terminal:

     ```bash
     javac <TopicFolder>/<FileName>.java
     java <TopicFolder>.<FileName>
     ```

## Future Enhancements

* Add **unit tests** (e.g. using JUnit) to verify correctness.
* Include **time and space complexity** notes in comments.
* Expand the repository with **graph algorithms** and **dynamic programming** topics.
