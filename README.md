# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Java**, built as part of my practice and learning journey. It covers fundamental concepts used in computer science, competitive programming, and software development.

## 📌 Topics Covered

* **Arrays and ArrayList** – basic operations, dynamic arrays
* **Searching** – Linear Search, Binary Search
* **Sorting** – Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
* **Recursion & Backtracking** – recursive problem solving, backtracking examples
* **Strings** – manipulation, pattern problems
* **Linked Lists** – singly, doubly, and operations
* **Stacks & Queues** – stack operations, queue implementations
* **Trees** – binary trees, traversal methods, recursion on trees
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – classes, objects, and principles in practice
* **Time and Space Complexity** – analyzing efficiency of algorithms
* **Tic-Tac-Toe** – simple game implementation to apply OOP + logic

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo was created to:

* Strengthen **problem-solving skills** in Java.
* Build a solid foundation in **algorithms & data structures** for AI/ML and software engineering.
* Serve as a personal reference for coding interviews and academic projects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java (100%)
* **IDE/Tools:** VS Code

## 📂 Structure

Each folder corresponds to a **topic/lecture** and contains Java implementations with examples.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add unit tests for algorithm correctness.
* Include complexity analysis in code comments.
* Expand into graph algorithms and dynamic programming.
